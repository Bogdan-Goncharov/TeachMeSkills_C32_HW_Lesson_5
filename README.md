Task 0

Create a three-dimensional array of integers.
Use loops to iterate through the entire array and increase each element by a given number.
Let the number by which each element will be increased be entered from the console.

Task 1:

Chess Board
Create a program to paint a chessboard using a loop. 
Create a two-dimensional array of Strings 8x8. 
Use loops to assign the elements with values B (Black) or W (White). 
The result of the program should be:

W B W B W B W B
B W B W B W B W
W B W B W B W B
B W B W B W B W
W B W B W B W B
B W B W B W B W
W B W B W B W B
B W B W B W B W

Task 2: 

Matrix Multiplication
Create two arrays of integers with sizes 3x3 (two matrices).
Write a program to multiply the two matrices.
First array: {{1,0,0,0},{0,1,0,0},{0,0,0,0}}
Second array: {{1,2,3},{1,1,1},{0,0,0},{2,1,0}} 
Expected result: 1 2 3 1 1 1 0 0 0

Task 3

Create a two-dimensional array of integers.
Print the sum of all elements in the array to the console.
